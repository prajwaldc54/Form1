            It's not been a great season for KKR, but tonight they stepped up for a big win, by 54 runs, to stay alive in the tournament.
             Handshakes all around, Russell has a big smile on his face and has a chat with Umran Malik. KKR have jumped to sixth place now, 
             their NRR has gone up from -0.057 to 0.160. For Sunrisers, it is their fifth loss on the bounce after starting the tournament with five wins in a row. 
             What a change of fortunes for them. Of the eight teams left for the playoffs, they are right at the bottom now, the only team with eight points, and an NRR of -0.270. 
             They never really looked in the chase today, except when Abhishek Sharma was batting, and they will need an overhaul of either Williamson's batting or their top order so revive whatever is left for them now.

            Shreyas Iyer: Our mindset we came with in this game was outstanding,
            we were positive and it was really important to win this toss. Batting first in Pune teams have won a lot of matches.
            We were going over by over while batting, plan was to give Russell as much strike as possible and we were praying that he plays the last over 
            because Washington had an over left. It worked out pretty well. 177 against them was over par, the way Sunny [Narine] and Varun stepped up on a slow wicket, 
            they were pretty smart and we never let them [Sunrisers] get under our skin. We don't have anything to lose right now, we haven't played our A game so far in the league.
            We really stepped up pretty well today. And also I want to clarify from the last interview, when I took the CEO's name [for team selections], I meant he's there to console the players who are sitting out,
             it's never easy for them.
